#### Merge

Merge some attributes into one document.

Example:

```javascript
var someAttributes = {
  lastName: 'Simpson',
  favoriteFood: 'beer'
};

var id = 'homer@simpsons.com';

User.merge(id, someAttributes, function(err, homer) {

Authenticate against the CouchDB user database (`_users`).

Example:

var username = req.param('username');
var password = req.param('password');

Users.authenticate(username, password, function(err, sessionId, username, roles) {
  // ...
});
```


#### Session

Get the CouchDB session object.

Example:

```javascript
var sessionId = req.cookies.sid;
Users.session(sessionId, function(err, session) {
  // ...
});
```

## Waterline

[Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) is a brand new kind of storage and retrieval engine.

It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs. That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in MySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.
